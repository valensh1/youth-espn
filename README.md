<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

### Youth Sports Gamerz

Welcome to Youth Sports Gamerz, the ESPN for youth sports! My mission is to fill the gap in the youth sports industry by providing a comprehensive platform dedicated to all things youth sports. This is an ongoing project that has turned into a hobby of mine and will encounter frequent updates.

In the vast landscape of sports media, there's a noticeable lack of content catering specifically to youth sports. Despite being a significant industry with a huge total addressable market, some current solutions, such as Team Snap and Sports Engine, fall short of providing a holistic experience.
Youth Sports Gamerz is an application that aims to change that. It's not just another sports app, it's a one-stop shop for everything youth sports.

Features

- Spotlight Articles: Read about special teams and players gaining national attention. Our platform brings you closer to the action and the stars of tomorrow.
- Game Stats and Scores: Stay updated with real-time game stats and scores. Never miss a moment of the action.
- Game Schedules and Standings: Plan ahead with game schedules and keep track of your team's progress with updated standings.
- Player Pages: Dive into individual player pages complete with images and player highlights and stats.
- Equipment Shop: Browse and shop for equipment right within the app. We bring the sports store to your fingertips. <span style="color:red">Coming Soon!</span>
- Coaching Lessons: Schedule coaching lessons for personalized training and skill development. <span style="color:red">Coming Soon!</span>

  Join us at Youth Sports Gamerz as we revolutionize the youth sports experience!

## Acknowledgments

This project wouldn't have been possible without the use of several open-source tools and libraries.

- **Img Shields**: For providing me with a simple and concise way to create badges for my README. The badges have made my project more informative and visually appealing.

- **React Icons**: For their comprehensive library of popular icon sets in a single package. It has greatly enhanced the user interface of my application.

- **React YouTube**: For their easy-to-use React component for rendering YouTube videos. It has significantly improved the multimedia experience of my application.

- **Dotenv**: For their module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. It has helped me manage and secure my application's configuration.

- **Concurrently**: For their utility that manages multiple concurrent tasks. It has streamlined my development process by allowing me to run my server and client simultaneously.

I highly recommend these tools to other developers. Their contribution to the open-source community is invaluable.
